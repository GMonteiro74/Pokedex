# Pokedex 
### Pokemon encyclopedia and community

In this project we used Handlebars, JavaScript, CSS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express and REST APIs. We created a web app where users can create their own pokemons, check on others creations and rate them!

It is also possible to use it to search for Pokemons and game locations (Nintendo Pokemon games) and use it to gather information from them, such as the types and stats.
